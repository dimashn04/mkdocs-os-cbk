## Backup Your SSH and GPG Keys!

Genuine (ORI) Computer Science students back up their KEYS!  
Fake (KW) students keep sobbing because they are losing their keys.

### Step 1: Set the current week. E.g., for Week 02:
```plaintext
WEEK=02
```

In another week, the number will obviously be different.

### Step 2: Find your GnuPG ID. E.g.,:

```bash
gpg --list-key --keyid-format long
```

### Step 3: Set your GnuPG ID. E.g., for CBKADAL:
```plaintext
KEYID=60914D29C01C81F1
```

Remember, <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold; font-size:larger;">you are not cbkadal!</span>

### Step 4: Set and list the “myBACKUP/” directory.
```plaintext
mkdir -pv $HOME/myBACKUP/
ls -al $HOME/myBACKUP/
```

### Step 5: If necessary, copy or set all changed keys.
```plaintext
/bin/cp -vf $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519     $HOME/myBACKUP/
/bin/cp -vf $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub $HOME/myBACKUP/
gpg --armor --yes --output $HOME/myBACKUP/mySECRETgnupgKEY.asc --export-secret-keys $KEYID
ls -al  $HOME/myBACKUP/
```

### Step 6: Create a “PROOF” file for the WEEK.
```plaintext
pushd $HOME/myBACKUP/
rm -vf  WEEK??-MD5SUM.txt
md5sum id_ed25519 id_ed25519.pub mySECRETgnupgKEY.asc | tee WEEK$WEEK-MD5SUM.txt
ls -al
popd
```

### Step 7: Copy the “PROOF” file.
```plaintext
pushd $HOME/myBACKUP/
mkdir -pv $HOME/RESULT/W$WEEK/
cp -v WEEK$WEEK-MD5SUM.txt $HOME/RESULT/W$WEEK/
ls -al $HOME/RESULT/W$WEEK/
popd
```

### Last Step: Save/Backup/Copy Your Keys Somewhere Else
It is highly recommended that you secure all the contents of the “myBACKUP/”
folder to an external medium such as a flash drive.

### WARNING

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold; font-size:larger;">Never ever</span>
submit your files like "mySECRETgnupgKEY.asc" and "id_ed25519"!<br>
By the way, keep a copy of those keys OUTSIDE your virtual guest!
